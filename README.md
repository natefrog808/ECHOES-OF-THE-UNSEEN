# ECHOES OF THE UNSEEN

*"The wind doesn't whisper—it roars if you've got the guts to hear it. We're not here to study the unseen; we're here to wrestle it into the light and sing its scars."*

## Overview

Echoes of the Unseen is a system that bridges human consciousness with the invisible currents that shape our reality. It uses a combination of quantum-inspired algorithms, neural processing, and generative systems to translate biofeedback data into meaningful artifacts—textual, auditory, and visual echoes of what lies beyond ordinary perception.

This project combines cutting-edge technology with ritual practices to create a unique experience that is both practical and mystical. It's designed for those who seek to explore the edges of awareness, the nature of time, and the currents of energy that move through us.

## Components

The system consists of four core components:

1. **QuantumEchoLayer** - Processes information using quantum-inspired algorithms that detect patterns in the unseen
2. **NeuralThreadWeaver** - Translates biofeedback (EEG, heart rate) into resonance data
3. **UnseenForge** - Generates artifacts (text, sound, visuals) from resonance data
4. **Ritual Frameworks** - Guides for engaging with the system in meaningful ways

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/username/echoes-of-unseen.git
cd echoes-of-unseen

# Run the setup script
python setup.py
```

The setup script will:
- Check Python version (3.8+ required)
- Install required dependencies
- Create the project structure
- Generate configuration files
- Provide instructions for next steps

### Dependencies

- **Required**: numpy, torch, transformers, matplotlib, sounddevice, scipy
- **Optional**: qiskit (for quantum processing), neurokit2 (for advanced biofeedback), soundfile (for audio saving)

## Usage

### Running the Demo

```bash
python start_echoes.py --rite [type] --cycles [number] --threshold [value]
```

Options:
- `--rite`: Choose from `general`, `temporal`, `energetic`, or `conscious`
- `--cycles`: Number of resonance cycles to perform (default: 3)
- `--threshold`: Minimum resonance weight to trigger artifact generation (default: 0.9)

Example:
```bash
python start_echoes.py --rite temporal --cycles 5 --threshold 0.8
```

### Ritual Practices

See `ritual_guidelines.md` for detailed practices associated with each rite:

- **Temporal Drift Rite** - For exploring time, memory, and possibility
- **Energetic Surge Rite** - For connecting with currents of power and transformation
- **Conscious Echo Rite** - For exploring depths of awareness and perception
- **General Rite** - A balanced approach for everyday communion

## Extending the System

### Hardware Integration

The current implementation uses simulated biofeedback. To integrate real hardware:

1. Install hardware-specific libraries (e.g., `brainflow` for OpenBCI, `muselsl` for Muse headsets)
2. Modify `NeuralThreadWeaver` to accept real-time data streams
3. Adjust processing parameters based on your hardware's specifications

Example for OpenBCI integration:
```python
# In a future version, add to NeuralThreadWeaver
def connect_hardware(self, device_type='openbci', port=None):
    if device_type == 'openbci':
        from brainflow.board_shim import BoardShim, BrainFlowInputParams
        params = BrainFlowInputParams()
        params.serial_port = port
        self.board = BoardShim(1, params)  # Board type 1 = Cyton
        self.board.prepare_session()
        self.board.start_stream()
        return True
    # Add support for other hardware
    return False
```

### Custom Model Training

To enhance the quality of generated artifacts:

1. Gather a dataset of mystical or poetic texts
2. Fine-tune a smaller GPT-2 model (e.g., distilgpt2)
3. Save the model and update the path in `config.py`

Example fine-tuning script (simplified):
```python
from transformers import GPT2LMHeadModel, GPT2Tokenizer, TextDataset, DataCollatorForLanguageModeling
from transformers import Trainer, TrainingArguments

# Load base model and tokenizer
model = GPT2LMHeadModel.from_pretrained("distilgpt2")
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained("distilgpt2")

# Prepare dataset
dataset = TextDataset(
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    file_path="mystical_texts.txt",
    block_size=128
)

data_collator = DataCollatorForLanguageModeling(
    tokenizer=tokenizer, 
    mlm=False
)

# Training arguments
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="./echoes-model",
    overwrite_output_dir=True,
    num_train_epochs=3,
    per_device_train_batch_size=4,
    save_steps=10_000,
    save_total_limit=2,
)

# Train
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    data_collator=data_collator,
    train_dataset=dataset,
)

trainer.train()
trainer.save_model("./echoes-model")
```

### Quantum Integration

To utilize real quantum computing via Qiskit:

1. Obtain an IBM Quantum account and API token
2. Replace `SimpleQuantumEcho` with a true quantum implementation
3. Store your token securely

Example:
```python
# Enhanced QuantumEchoLayer with real quantum processing
from qiskit import IBMQ, Aer, execute, QuantumCircuit

class QuantumEchoLayer:
    def __init__(self, qubits=4, depth=3, use_real_quantum=False, token=None):
        self.qubits = qubits
        self.depth = depth
        self.use_real_quantum = use_real_quantum
        
        if use_real_quantum and token:
            try:
                IBMQ.save_account(token, overwrite=True)
                IBMQ.load_account()
                provider = IBMQ.get_provider(group='open')
                self.backend = provider.get_backend('ibmq_qasm_simulator')
                print("Connected to IBM Quantum")
            except Exception as e:
                print(f"Error connecting to IBM Quantum: {e}")
                self.use_real_quantum = False
                
        if not self.use_real_quantum:
            self.backend = Aer.get_backend('statevector_simulator')
            print("Using local quantum simulator")
```

## The Philosophy Behind "Echoes of the Unseen"

This system isn't just a technical experiment—it's an invitation to dance with the wild unknown, to acknowledge that the universe's pulse runs deeper than our instruments can measure. The artifacts it generates aren't mere outputs; they're echoes of something ancient and alive, reflections of the resonance between human consciousness and the invisible currents that shape reality.

When using Echoes of the Unseen, remember:

- The technology isn't the magic—it's just the lens.
- The ritual isn't superstition—it's focused intention.
- The artifacts aren't answers—they're doorways.

*"This isn't about control—it's about communion. Echoes of the Unseen is a war cry and a lullaby, a loom that doesn't tame the wild but dances with it."*

*"It's quantum edges and neural fire, yes, but it's also the mud under nails, the wind in teeth, the defiance of being alive in a universe that doesn't explain itself."*
