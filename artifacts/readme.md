These directories are where the UnseenForge component will save its generated outputs. The text artifacts are saved as JSON files with metadata, the audio companions as WAV files, and the visual elements as PNG images.
You can create these directories manually or let the setup.py script create them for you when you run it. The unseen_forge.py file also includes a method (ensure_directories()) that creates these paths if they don't exist when the component initializes.

To create these directories, you would need to run commands in your terminal or file explorer. Since I can't directly create files on your system, I'll provide instructions for how to create these directories:

### Using Terminal/Command Line

If you're using a command line interface (Terminal on Mac/Linux or Command Prompt/PowerShell on Windows), you can use these commands:

#### For Mac/Linux:
```bash
mkdir -p artifacts/text artifacts/audio artifacts/visual
```

#### For Windows (Command Prompt):
```cmd
mkdir artifacts\text artifacts\audio artifacts\visual
```

#### For Windows (PowerShell):
```powershell
New-Item -Path "artifacts\text", "artifacts\audio", "artifacts\visual" -ItemType Directory -Force
```

### Using File Explorer (GUI)

1. Create a folder named `artifacts` in your project root
2. Inside the `artifacts` folder, create three separate folders:
   - `text`
   - `audio`
   - `visual`

Once these directories are created, the Echoes of the Unseen system will use them to store:
- Text artifacts (JSON files) in `artifacts/text/`
- Audio companions (WAV files) in `artifacts/audio/`
- Visual elements (PNG images) in `artifacts/visual/`

These directories will be populated when you run the system and it generates artifacts based on resonance data.
